# **Key Service: Refactor Plan**

This document outlines the architectural evolution of the key service, from its initial structure to its final, standardized implementation.

## **Final Refactor: Standardization on go-microservice-base**

The most significant refactoring effort was the adoption of the shared go-microservice-base library. This strategic move aligned the key service with the standard architectural pattern used across all of our Go microservices.

By embedding the microservice.BaseServer, the key service inherited a suite of production-ready features, drastically reducing boilerplate code and ensuring operational consistency.

### **Key Changes in the Final Refactor:**

1. **Service Wrapper (keyservice/service.go)**:
    * The keyservice.Wrapper struct now embeds microservice.BaseServer.
    * All custom code for starting, stopping, and managing the HTTP server (Start(), Shutdown(), Handler()) was removed and is now inherited from the base server.
2. **Main Executable (cmd/keyservice/main.go)**:
    * The main function was updated to follow the standard lifecycle pattern: configure, inject dependencies, create the service, signal readiness (service.SetReady(true)), and manage the blocking Start() and Shutdown() calls.
3. **API Handlers (internal/api/)**:
    * All instances of http.Error were replaced with calls to response.WriteJSONError. This ensures all API error responses are structured, consistent JSON objects.

### **Security Hardening Refactor (JWT)**

As part of the standardization, the service's authentication mechanism was significantly upgraded.

1. **Middleware Migration**:
    * The service was updated to use the new middleware.NewJWKSAuthMiddleware from the go-microservice-base library.
    * The insecure JWT\_SECRET was removed from the service's configuration.
    * The IDENTITY\_SERVICE\_URL was added to the configuration to allow the middleware to locate the identity service's public JWKS endpoint.
2. **Benefit**:
    * This change decouples the service from a shared secret, vastly improving the security posture of the entire system. Token validation is now done using a secure, industry-standard asymmetric key (RS256) pattern.

This final refactor achieved the project's goal of creating a robust, scalable, and maintainable service that is easy to operate and monitor.

## **Initial Architectural Refactor**

The following steps describe the foundational refactor that evolved the service from a single-file demo into a clean, layered application. This groundwork was essential for the final standardization.

### **Core Principles**

The refactor adhered to a standard Go project layout to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

* **pkg/**: Public, shareable libraries (the Store interface and Config struct).
* **internal/**: All private application logic (API handlers, concrete storage implementations).
* **keyservice/**: The primary, public-facing service library.
* **cmd/**: The thin executable wrapper for dependency injection.

### **Step-by-Step Guide (Initial Refactor)**

1. **Reorganize Project Structure**: Moved code into the standard pkg/, internal/, keyservice/, and cmd/ directories.
2. **Define Public Contract**: Created pkg/keyservice/store.go and pkg/keyservice/config.go to define the service's public interface.
3. **Create API Layer**: Isolated HTTP handler logic into the private internal/api/ package.
4. **Create Public Service Wrapper**: Built the primary keyservice/service.go library to assemble the service components.
5. **Create Main Executable**: Implemented the thin cmd/keyservice/main.go wrapper to assemble and run the service.
